<h2>About the Rabbit Health Database</h2>
<p>Thousands of rabbits' lives have been "sacrificed" in scientific experiments that provide the medical information
that we use for our own bunnies. HRS does not support harmful experimentation, but here's a way to contribute to the
body of information without harming anyone.</p>
<p>We are compiling health data on the bunnies in our homes into lifelong studies. In order to make these studies
statistically significant, we need a lot of data from you and your veterinarian. This is a way for you to make your
deceased bunnies' lives all the more important -- by contributing information that can improve, or even save, the lives
of other bunnies. As we develop the database more thoroughly, we hope it will become a valuable source for veterinarians
who treat our companion rabbits.</p>
