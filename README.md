## Rabbit Health Database

This is a prototype CouchApp that will allow house rabbit guardians to enter information about their
rabbits' health, laboratory tests, diet, and environment.  The primary goal of the database is to
create a repository for epidemiological information about house rabbits and to assist veterinarians
and researchers in creating ways to improve health and treatment.

The database was conceived and designed by Marinell Harriman of the [House Rabbit Society](http://www.rabbit.org).
At this time, the CouchApp version of the database is being developed by Paul Mietz Egli and
is not affiliated with HRS or any of its employees or volunteers.
